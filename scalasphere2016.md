# ScalaSphere 2016 - few impressions from tooling developer

## Scalasphere: conference focused on technical problems and solutions

ScalaSphere was one-of-the-kind conference focused completely on Scala tooling. Who expect presentations full of theory or math can be disappointed - conference was deeply technical. "I've never been on such deeply technical conferences" was often heard. I totally agree and I think this formula is really good.


## Quo vadis, scala tooling?

After Egugene's presentations on ScalaDays in [Berlin](http://scalamacros.org/paperstalks/2014-06-17-EasyMetaprogrammingForEveryone.pdf) and [Amsterdam](https://www.parleys.com/tutorial/state-meta-summer-2015) we put high hopes in scala.meta. Someone can even say that most tooling developers start making plans like _"when we have will scala.meta then we can ..."_.

The only problem is that Eugene cannot make it work with current scala AST what makes usages really limited . We can operate on AST but we lack information about types. We can modify AST (and this is relatively simple) but it won't be reflected in generated bytecode.

Eugene asked for help and inspiration, so:

## SBT, the only choice

Everybody use SBT, most complain and no one knows it. This is a sad true about build tools for scala.

We probably can't make sbt's internal simpler but we can fix DSL and dependencies resolution (both generated most complains).
Alexander [presented](http://scalasphere.org/speaker/alexandre-archambault/) his [coursair project](https://github.com/alexarchambault/coursier) addressing 2nd problem so we are still waiting for solution for sbt's DSL...

## IDEless or almost IDEless as alternative for "heavy" IDEs?

A year back I can't imagine developing Scala code without IDE. However impressed by progress done in [ensime](http://ensime.github.io/] (I am not more forced to use emacs!) or [Dave's ideas]([http://scalasphere.org/speaker/dave-gurnell) about IDEless work environment I think it is now possible to effectively work on big scala project outside Intellij or ScalaIDE.

## ScalaIDE, now we know why...

[Iulian](http://scalasphere.org/speaker/iulian-dragos/) opened conference with his talks about beginings and history of ScalaIDE. I finally heard explanation for multipe choices made those days (like waeving inside java model instead of creating new scala one). This talk was big warning for all tooling creators that sometimes it is worth to put more effort instead instead of taking _'let hack this and we got that for free'_ approach.
